    <h2>Welcome to New York!</h2>
    <p class="about-nyc">New York is city that has the power to draw people towards it. I remember being fascinated by the city long before I ever knew I was one day going to be living there. Popular culture and books had me visualizing New York since I was a teenager. When I received the admit to Pratt Institute, I was incredibly excited about living and learning in New York city. After being here for more than 3 months, I have tried to build this website to document my move to New York and how I went about discovering the city.</p>
    <h2>Places I visited</h2>
    <p>It is easy to feel overwhelmed by the sheer amount of things one can do in New York. Apart from visiting the popular landmarks, there are secret speakeasys, quiet piers and tucked away galleries that one can discover duting your time in the city. During my first few weeks, I tried to visit as many of the landmarks as possible. Summer is one of the ideal seasons to visit New York as you can make the most of the warm sunny days. Make sure to pack comfortable shoes since you will be on your feet a lot!</p>

    <h2>How to get around in New York City?</h2>
    <p class="subway"> According to <a href="https://www.nycsubwayguide.com/subway/basics.aspx" target="blank">NYC Subway Guide</a> : The subway system is the main public transportation system in New York. It is one of the oldest and largest public transportation systems in the world (in terms of number of stations). With some 5.5 million riders on a given weekday (before the coronvirus pandemic), it is one of the primary modes of transportation for the majority of New Yorkers and tourists. The system is operated by a subsidiary of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA).The subway system is usually just referred to as the "trains." Locals say "I can take the train to your place" to generally mean that they take the subway. The subway is never referred to as the metro, underground, or tube.Unless noted otherwise, I mean the subway system if I just use the word train by itself. While trains mostly run underground in Manhattan, a good portion of trains run on elevated tracks in the other boroughs. With some exceptions the whole subway system operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. It essentially never closes, except for major incidents such as hurricanes.
