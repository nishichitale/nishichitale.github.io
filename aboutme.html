      <p>Hi! I am Nishigandha Chitale. I am a UX Designer currently pursuing a Master's degree in Information Experience Design from Pratt Institute, New York. I have 3 years of experience as a UX Designer in India and I enjoy working on complex projects. I have worked in design studios with clients and teammates from all over the world. My last stint before rejoining academics was with a large enterprise tech company where I worked on building a planning tool.</p>

      <p>New York is city that has the power to draw people towards it. I remember being fascinated by the city long before I ever knew I was one day going to be living there. Popular culture and books had me visualizing New York since I was a child. When I received the admit to Pratt Institute, I was incredibly excited about living and learning in New York city. After being here for more than 3 months, I have tried to build this website to document my move to New York and how I went about discovering the city.</p>
