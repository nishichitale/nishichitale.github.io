      <h2>A Brief History of the City (20th Century)</h2>
      <div class="history-nyc">
      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.introducingnewyork.com/history" target="blank">Introducing New York website</a> : New York grew immensely during the twentieth century. The Statue of Liberty observed the arrival of millions of immigrants (in 1948 New York was the world’s most populated city, surpassing London). It became the hub of European, Asian and Latin-American immigration. After World War II, New York became the world’s most important city with great economic (Wall Street), political (UN Headquarters) and cultural relevance (replacing Paris as the mecca of art and culture). Thus, becoming a great international tourist site. The tragic terrorist attacks that took place in New York on 11 September, 2001, had far-reaching consequences in the States and in the rest of the world, establishing new security standards both in the city and worldwide. Today, New York is a dream destination for travelers from all over the world thanks to its appearance in hundreds of books, films and series. </p>
